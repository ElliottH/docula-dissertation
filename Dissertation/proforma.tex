\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
The intention of the project was to create software capable of producing
documentation from appropriately annotated source code. The software should be
compatible with existing comment formats and successfully output useful,
human-readable documentation.


\section*{Work Completed}
I successfully created a parser, and code capable of transforming the
resulting parse tree in to a set of HTML documents. The software created is also
capable of parsing directories of source code incrementally, so subsequent
executions complete much more quickly.

The parser produced does not have complete coverage of the C language, due
mainly to a lack of pre-processing being performed on the files being parsed, so
parsing of large codebases proved troublesome.


\section*{Special Difficulties}
Problems with tendonitis in the wrist caused some productivity problems
during Lent and Easter term.
